;; This patch is designed for MCL 2.0 final (p1 or not), I do not;; know if it will work under other versions of MCL.;; To apply the patch, evaluate the following expression and then;; simply quit MCL. The patch changes 2 bytes in a MCL code resource,;; the resource beeing updated automaticaly when MCL quits.;; The patch is permanent, you apply it only once. The patch will;; follow you across a SAVE-APPLICATION, no need to repatch newly;; created applications.(let (;; the long at this offset is the size of the chunks      ;; that will be used to write the application to disk      (offset #x566)      (resource (#_GetResource :|CODE| 3)))  (cond ((/= (%hget-long resource offset) #x00004000)         ;; check for original size 16k         (error "Something went wrong, patch not applied."))        (t ;; a new size of 4meg means the application           ;; will be written to disk in just one step           (%hput-long resource #x00400000 offset)           (#_ChangedResource resource)           (format t "~&;Patch applied, you can now simply quit."))))
