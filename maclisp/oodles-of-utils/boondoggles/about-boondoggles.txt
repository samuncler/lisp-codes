The files in this folder are generally quick hacks.They've made it out of the work-in-progress folder because theyshould pretty much stand on their own and be usable.They haven't made it into the oou mainstream either because theyneed more work or because they're really boondoggles.So use these files at your own risk. In future version of oou theymay disappear or be substantially redesigned.If you want to use one, I recommend making a copy of it in yourproject file and using it as the basis of your own work.
