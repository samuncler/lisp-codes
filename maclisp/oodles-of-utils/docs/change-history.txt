v 1.2 - styled TextEdit support - see te-view or te-dim - quick fix for draggable-svm & non-black hilite color bug - QD-fx wipes are now much faster - set-view-size & set-view-position now work for GWorld-views - wmgr-view now returns a CGrafPort for wptr when color is available - bug fixes to set-view-size & set-view-position for video-digitizer-svm - forgot to export GWorld-view - Corrected bug in get-picture-from-file - Corrected typos in the GWorld-view export list which caused   GWorld-alloc,GWorld-realloc, & GWorld-free to not be exportedv 1.1 - draggable-svm now has an option for dragging the image of   the view rather than just the outline. - the oou package no longer uses common-lisp-user - GWorld-u is no longer exported    To work with GWorlds you should now use the GWorld-view class.    It's much more compatible with MCL. - with-xMapPtr removed - with-current-port-xMapPtr removed - with-current-portBits added - view-portBits method added    All these changes were made to reflect a new philosophy of    passing (pref xGrafPort :GrafPort.portBits) into CopyBits.    This works for both GrafPorts and CGrafPorts and is more    efficient than getting the BitMap/PixMapPtr which these    macros used to facilitate. I know this will break some    code - sorry, but it should be easy to make the necessary    repairs. See IM V p. 70 for details. - bug fix - static text di & svm now erases when you change   the text string or font.oodles-of-utils version 1.0 - works with MCL final, will not work with 2.0b1pXX - numerous bug fixes - documentation is now in a separate documentNotes to users of earlier versions: - Take the time to read the new documentation. - You MUST use oou-depencies instead of require to load oou files.   oou-init no longer burden's requires search path with the myriad   of oou folders. - Many dialog item mixins have switched to simple view mixins. For example,   static-text-dim is now static-text-svm. They will work as before + can   be mixed into simple-views and views (& possibly windows). - Due to changes in MCLs handling of traps, I've had to come up with my   own Not In ROM trap syntax (to avoid name conflicts). This is explained   fully in the documentation. Basically, you use #~TrapName to call the   Not In ROM traps.
