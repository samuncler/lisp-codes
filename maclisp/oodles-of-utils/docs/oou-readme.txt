oodles-of-utils is a large collection of MCL code to help access theMac ToolBox and create user interfaces. It requires MCL 2.0 finalor later. To learn more about them, read the documention. Mike Engber The Institute for the Learning Sciences 1890 Maple Ave Evanston, IL  60201 (708)467-1006  from InterNet: engber@ils.nwu.edu from AppleLink: engber@ils.nwu.edu@INTERNET#from CompuServe: >INTERNET:engber@ils.nwu.eduThe oodles-of-utils distribution currently consists of two main files.oou-lisp The complete lisp source for oou + the documentation.oou-fasl The oou source files compiled with whatever settings I'm currently using - which are probably all the expensive ones turned on, like *fasl-save-local-symbols*, ... I'm providing the fasl files as a convenience. You can easily compile oou yourself, but it can take a while if you machine is slow or you're tight on memory. Note: To use the fasl files you need to put the oou-fasl folder in the oou folder.If you see other files in the directory these are additions or bug fixesissued in the intermim between new versions.DocumentationThe oodles-of-utils folder now has an docs sub-folder.The documentaion for oou has grown so large (70+ pages, table of contents,index, appendicies, ...) and cumbersome that I was forced to abandonplain text files. The main documentaion file is oou-docs.RTFoou-docs was written using Microsoft Word, but I'm distributing it inMicrosoft's RTF format which a variety of word processors can read.No information from the original MS Word document should be lost. Inaddition, RTF format avoids some of MS Word's pitfalls (storing fontsby id instead of name, incompatabilities between versions 4.0x & 5.0xof MS Word (which are 100% compatible)) If you cannot find a way to reador print the docs, contact me and I'll try to arrange something.oou-docs are desinged for double-sided hardcopy. So for the nicestresults, either print them double-sided or duplicate them double-side.ILS users should see me before printing out the docs. I'm going to tryand arrange to have ILS keep some nicely printed and bound copies available.If you choose to view oou-docs online using MS Word, it will be infinitelymore legible if you turn OFF the display of hidden text and paragraph marks.
