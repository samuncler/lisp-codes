applescript-from-lispThis is an updated version of my utilities which allows lisp to send applescriptto scriptable applications, record from them etc.  There are 5 files in thispackage:Read Me - This file.AESTUFF.LISP  Some CLOS cover for the low level grunge of dealing withapplescript.  This needs to be loaded before the next 2 files.APPLESCRIPT.LISP  A partial implementation of the applescript interface.  Enoughto do recording, and send scripts to scriptable applications.APPLESCRIPT EDITOR.LISP NOTE:  THIS VERSION WORKS WITH EITHER MCL2.01 OR 3.0B3 A convenienteditor to create scripts from within lisp.  OSA.LISP  The interface file!  NOTE: If you are using MCL3.0b3 or later you don't need OSA.LISP since it isprovided in your interfaces folder.OSA.LISP needs to go in ccl:library;interfaces; if you don't already have it. If you put it in there don't forget to call (reindex-interfaces)Read the changes at the top of the files.  Let me know if there are problems.T. Bonurabonura@apple.com
