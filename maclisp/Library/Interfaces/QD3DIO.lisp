You may define the format of your ;  *	data any way you wish as long as you use the primitives types above and the;  *	routines below.;  *;  *	Root Objects are often appended with additional child objects, called ;  *	subobjects. You may append your object with other QuickDraw 3D objects.;  *	;  *	Writing is straightforward: an object traverses itself any other objects ;  *	that make it up, then writes its own data. Writing uses two methods: ;  *	TQ3ObjectTraverseMethod and TQ3ObjectWriteMethod.;  *;  *	The TQ3ObjectTraverseMethod method should:;  *	+ First, Determine if the data should be written ;  *		- if you don't want to write out your object after examining your;  *			data, return kQ3Success in your Traverse method without calling;  *			any other submit calls.;  * 	+ Next, calculate the size of your object on disk;  * 	+ Gather whatever state from the view you need to preserve;  * 		- you may access the view state NOW, as the state of the;  * 			view duing your TQ3ObjectWriteMethod will not be valid. You may;  * 			pass a temporary buffer to your write method.;  * 	+ Submit your view write data using Q3View_SubmitWriteData;  * 		- note that you MUST call this before any other "_Submit" call.;  * 		- you may pass in a "deleteMethod" for your data. This method;  * 			will be called whether or not your write method succeeds or fails.;  * 	+ Submit your subobjects to the view;  * 	;  * 	The TQ3ObjectWriteMethod method should:;  * 	+ Write your data format to the file using the primitives routines below.;  * 		- If you passed a "deleteMethod" in your Q3View_SubmitWriteData, that;  *	 		method will be called upon exit of your write method.;  *;  *	Reading is less straightforward because your root object and;  *	any subobjects must be read inside of your TQ3ObjectReadDataMethod. There ;  *	is an implicit state contained in the file while reading, which you must ;  *	be aware of. When you first enter the read method, you must physically ;  *	read in your data format using the primitives routines until;  *	;  *	Q3File_IsEndOfData(file) == kQ3True;  *	;  *	Generally, your data format should be self-descriptive such that you do not;  *	need to call Q3File_IsEndOfData to determine if you are done reading. ;  *	However, this call is useful for determining zero-sized object or ;  *	determining the end of an object's data.;  *	;  *	Once you have read in all the data, you may collect subobjects. A metafile;  *	object ONLY has subobjects if it is in a container. The call;  *	;  *	Q3File_IsEndOfContainer(file);  *	;  *	returns kQ3False if subobjects exist, and kQ3True if subobjects do not ;  *	exist.;  *	;  *	At this point, you may use;  *	;  *	Q3File_GetNextObjectType;  *	Q3File_IsNextObjectOfType;  *	Q3File_ReadObject;  *	Q3File_SkipObject;  *	;  *	to iterate through the subobjects until Q3File_IsEndOfContainer(file) ;  *	is kQ3True.;  * ; ; ;  *	TQ3ObjectTraverseMethod;  *;  *	For "elements" (meaning "attributes, too), you will be passed NULL for ;  *	object. Sorry, custom objects will be available in the next major revision.;  *;  *	The "data" is a pointer to your internal element data.;  *;  *	The view is the current traversal view.; (def-mactype :tq3objecttraversemethod (find-mactype ':pointer));
