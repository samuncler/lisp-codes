README for ccl:examples;series; folder.Last updated 10/09/96 by slh.This directory contains the files S.LISP, SDOC.TXT, and STEST.LISP, as obtained from the "/pub/series/" anonymous FTP directory on ftp.ai.mit.eduon January 13, 1992.See the file "SDOC.TXT" for general installation instructions.  Note thatthe SERIES package defined in "S.LISP" uses the "LISP" (vice "COMMON-LISP")package and that the IN-PACKAGE form near the beginning of that fileis a call to the (CLtL1) function of that name.To compile this file in MCL, it's necessary to make sure that the "LISP"package is defined and that the current package is some package whichuses the "LISP" package - the "USER" package, for instance.One way of doing this is (from a Listener window):? (require "LISP-PACKAGE")"LISP-PACKAGE"? (in-package "USER")#<Package "USER">? (load (compile-file "ccl:examples;series;s.lisp"))...-end-
