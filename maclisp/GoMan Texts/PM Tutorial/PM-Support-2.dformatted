          1. Class Tree Specification           The German future tense is formed with the auxiliary "werden ".      Therefore, the PIClass defining the future is preferably added as      a son node of the node (PIClass Auxiliary). We will call it      (PIClass Future).         •  Open the class window   and extend the PIClass tree.         •  Select the node (PIClass Perfect)         •  Choose 'New Brother' in the Edit menu         •  Into the dialogue box, type: (PIClass Future)        •  Click OK           Figure 1.1 Class Tree with (PIClass Future)     Of course, this is only a suggestion. Other names and other tree      structures are possible. It is important, however, to choose node      names with the attribute "PIClass " (Periphrastic Inflection      Class).      Go back to the tutorial for the specification of the syntax tree.      2. Syntax Tree           The syntax tree of the future tense can be represented as      follows:      Figure 2.1 Syntax Tree Future Tense     In this form, the structure of the tree is identical to the tree of      the perfect tense. Consequently, the linear representation of this      tree is exactly the same as the syntax tree specification in the      (PIClass Perfect).         •  Open the window (PIClass Future) by clicking the node             in the Class window. Into the window type:         •  SYNTAX-TREE        •  Newline         •  (VP V V)          Figure 2.2 Syntax Tree (PIClass Future)     Go back to the tutorial for the specification of the next      specification step (step 3).      3. Modifications           In the window (PIClass Future), type:         •  MODIFICATIONS         •  Newline      Modifications specify which words of a phrase may be associated      with “external” words. In the future tense, external words can      stand between the two verb forms. There are different manners      to express this:         •  V-1 >            The first verb may be associated with external words             on its right-hand side. Digits are used when a syntax             tree contains identical symbols. The above can also be             expressed without a digit, since a symbol without a             digit stands for the first symbol from the left:             V >        •  V-2 <            The second verb may be associated with external words             on its left-hand side.      Type one of these possibilities on a new line underneath the      subtitle MODIFICATIONS. We have chosen the specification      without digit:      Figure 3.1 Modifications (PIClass Future)     Go back to the tutorial for the fourth specification step.      4. Transformations           The two verb-forms can be inverted. This is exactly the same      syntactical transformation the two verb-forms of the perfect      can be subject to.      Figure 4.1 Inversion Perfect and Future     Transformation rules are not specified within the PIClass but in      a separate window 'Transformations'. There, they are specified      together with a rule identifier. By means of these rule      identifiers, you specify in the class window which      transformation may be applied on the class.      As we have seen, the transformations allowed for the perfect      and the future tenses are identical. Consequently, we can use the      same rule identifier for both PIClasses, viz. "VV-Inversion ".      So, go into the window (PIClass Future) and type, on a new line:         •  TRANSFORMATIONS        •  Newline         •  VV-Inversion          Figure 4.2 Transformations (PIClass Future)     With this specification we indicate, that the transformation rule      "VV-Inversion " is responsible for the syntactical      transformations regarding the future tense. Since we already      have specified this transformation rule for the perfect tense,      the indication of the rule identifier is sufficient.      Nevertheless, have a look at the rule in the window      Transformations   in order to remember how a transformation      rule has to be specified.      Go back to the tutorial for the fifth specification step.      5. Periphrastic Inflection           Like transformations, periphrastic inflection rules are not      specified within the PIClass definition. They are formalized in a      separate window together with a PI-rule identifier. By means of      these rule identifiers, you specify in the PIClass window which      PI-rules are responsible for the class.      For the periphrastic inflection rule responsible for the German      future tense we suggest an easily intelligible name like      "Auxiliary-Future ".      So, go into the window (PIClass Future). On a new line, under the      specification of the Transformations, type:         •  PERIPHR-INFL        •  Newline         •  Auxiliary-Future        •  Newline           Figure 5.1 Periphrastic Inflection (PIClass Future)     Go back to the tutorial for the example specification (step 6).      6. Example           6.1. Example Phrase      The example phrase for the German future tense is quite simple.      The verb "werden " is combined with an infinitive.      In the window (PIClass Future), on a new line, type         •  EXAMPLE        •  Newline         •  <werden>            The pointed brackets indicate that "werden " may be             inflected.         •  White Space (or Tab)         •  inf            "inf " stands for "infinitive ". It is a keyword that you             will have to specify in a separate window. Of course,             you can choose another keyword for the infinitive.             However, it must not be homographic with any             wordform likely ever to be stored in the database.         •  Newline      The example specification      <werden> inf     says, that an inflected wordform of the lexeme "werden " and a      past participle are combined to form an entity.      6.2. Keyword Specification           To indicate the infinitive, you used the keyword "inf " (or,      perhaps, another one). Keywords are simple identifiers      representing feature sets. The specification of keywords takes      place in the window 'Keywords'.         •  Click the keywords button   in the document window to             open the window.      The window already contains the keyword "pp " that we have      specified for the (PIClass Perfect). To add your new keyword         •  go into the window 'Key-Words'         •  on a new line, type:             inf = (Cat V)(Mod Inf)(Temp Pres)        •  Newline      The feature set on the right-hand side of the equals sign is the      feature set that qualifies the infinitive of verbs in the database      German-PM-W3. You can check this by opening the lexical      browser of any verb ( "haben ", "schlagen ", "gehen ", etc.).      Figure 6.1 Keyword Specification “inf”     After the specification of the keyword, close the window      Key-Words and go back to the (PIClass Future)      6.3. Morphological Restrictions      There are two elements in the example phrase: "<werden> " and      "inf ".         •  "werden " may be inflected. To what extend is not             relevant here, as we will see with the specification of             the periphrastic inflection rule. So, type on a new line,             underneath the example phrase:             werden   (Cat V)        •  The keyword "inf " is already specified as a wordform             with the feature set (Cat V)(Mod Inf)(Temp Pres) (cf.             previous section   ). No more indications are needed.             When a keyword does not require further restrictions -             as it is the case here - you do not have to specify any             morphological restrictions.      Finally, do not forget, that every example must be closed by the      indication of individual modifications. There are none.         •  Type a hyphen "- ", on a new line.           Figure 6.2 Example Specification (PIClass Future)     Go back to the tutorial for the specification of the periphrastic      inflection rule (step 7).      7. Periphrastic Inflection Rule         •  Open the window Periphrastic-Inflections by clicking             the periphr   button in the document window.         •  In the window, on a new line, type the rule identifier             you have chosen. We have suggested the following             Auxiliary-Future     The actual PIRule is specified under this title. A PIRule consists      of two parts separated by an equals sign.      On the left-hand side, you specify which wordforms of the      lexemes specified in the PIClass form the cluster.      For the German future, the wordforms of the indicative present      (Mod Ind)(Temp Pres) of "werden " are combined with an      infinitive. So, type:         •  Newline         •  (Cat V)(Mod Ind)(Temp Pres) + inf            The wordforms of the present are qualified by these             features; we have already defined the keyword "inf " for             the infinitive (cf. Keyword Specification   )         •  one or more White Spaces (or Tabs), then the equals sign             "= ".      On the right-hand side of the equals sign, you specify some      characteristics of the combined periphrastic inflection cluster:         •  one or more White Spaces (or Tabs)         •  Position of the cluster in an analyzed phrase: The             position of the cluster in a phrase must be the same as             the position of the first element (1) on the left-hand             side, i.e. the position of the future tense in an analyzed             phrase is the same as the position of the auxiliary.             For example, the sentences             	er WIRD den Hund SCHLAGEN	sie WIRD nach Hause GEHEN                        will be analyzed as             	er WIRD SCHLAGEN den Hund	sie WIRD GEHEN nach Hause                         Compare these sentences with the following (in the             present tense):             	er SCHLÄGT den Hund	sie GEHT nach Hause                         Therefore type:             (POS 1)        •  The citation form of the lexeme the cluster belongs to:             The wordforms of the future belong to the lexeme of the             infinitive (2), not to the auxiliary "werden " (1).             Therefore, type immediately after (POS 1):             (CFORM 2)        •  The percolation of wordform features from the             left-hand side: A wordform of the future has the same             person and number features as the auxiliary (1):             "wirst"		(Cat V)(Mod Ind)(Temp Pres)(Pers 2nd)(Num SG)"wirst gehen"	(Cat V)(Mod Ind)(Temp Fut)(Pers 2nd)(Num SG)                        i.e. features are percolated from the auxiliary (1).             Therefore, type immediately after (CFORM 1)             (PERC 1)            Since only features that are not used as restrictions on             the left-hand side are percolated, only the number and             the person features will be percolated. Cf. feature set             of "wirst " above and the specification of the left hand             side we have already done.         •  To complete this PIRule, we must specify the             characteristic features of the future tense that are not             percolated from the left-hand side. So, type             immediately after (PERC 2):             (Cat V)(Mod Ind)(Temp Fut)     The Periphrastic Inflection Rule for the future should look like      this:      Figure 7.1 PIRule “Auxiliary Future”     Go back to the tutorial for the compilation of your specification      (step 8).      8. Compilation           The specification of the Periphrastic Inflection class for the      future tense is completed. You can now compile your version of      the database German-W3.         •  Choose 'Run Compiler' in the Phrase Manager Menu           •  Click OK in the dialogue box      If you have carried out all specification steps correctly, the      following message will be displayed in the message window:       > PM Compilation ok. It took ... seconds.     ----------------------------------------------------------      If you have made any mistakes, the system will warn you with an      acoustic signal and an error message. If this is the case, correct      the error and try to compile the PM-specification again.      If you do not succeed in detecting and correcting the error, we      suggest that you close the database German-PM-W3 WITHOUT      saving it. Then, go back in the Tutorial and try it once again. Go      back   .      If that does not work either, you can open the database      German-PM-W4   to compare it with your specification. It is an      already compiled copy of the specification we described for      German-PM-W3.      ----------------------------------------------------------      When the database is successfully compiled, you can test the      PIClass specification:         •  Open the 'Message' or the PM-Test window by clicking             the corresponding button in the document window of the             database.         •  Type the examples given below into the window         •  Select them one by one (e.g. with a triple-click)         •  Choose 'Recognize' in the PhraseManager Menu   (or type             CTRL+K)         •  Compare the results of the retrieve with the comments             to the examples below.      ***      1) ich werde gehen	'I will/shall go'      Must be recognized as wordform in the future tense of "gehen ":      Note the indication of the periphrastic inflection in the last text      field of the retrieval dialog.      ***      2)  er wird schlagen	'he will beat'      Must be recognized as wordform of "schlagen " with the features      (Cat V)(Mod Ind)(Temp Fut)(Pers 3rd)(Num SG)      ***      3)  du wirst alt sein		lit. 'you will be old'      "wirst sein " must be recognized as 2nd person singular future      tense of "sein ". The first verb form may be associated with      external words (here: "alt ") on its right-hand side. Cf.      Modifications        ***      4)  wir werden diesen menschen kennen			'we shall/will known this person'      "werden kennen " must be recognized as future tense of "kennen "      (modifications; cf. 3). Note that "werden kennen " can be the 1st      and the 3rd person plural. This, because in these two persons of      the present indicative "werden " is ambiguous. This ambiguity is      correctly percolated on the periphrastic cluster.      ***      5) 	dass du gehen wirst 		'that you will go'	dass wir schlagen werden	'that we shall/will beat'     Must be recognized as wordforms of "gehen " and "schlagen ",      respectively. In subordinate clauses like these, the word order in      the future cluster is inverted. Therefore, inversion must be      allowed; cf. Transformations        ***      6) As a last test, we can take the example of the first PHClass (      "in das gras beissen "):      	er wird ins gras beissen	dass er ins gras beissen wird          '(that) he will bite into the grass' = 'he will kick the bucket'      In both sentences (main and subordinate clause), "wird beissen "      must be recognized as the 3rd person singular future tense of      "beissen ". Note the position of the cluster in the analyzed      sentence.      **********      When the results of the retrieves are as described, the      specification of the PIClass is correct. If not, check your      specification thoroughly.      If you do not succeed in detecting and correcting the error, we      suggest that you close the database German-PM-W3 WITHOUT      saving it. Then, try it once again. Go back   .      If that does not work either, you can open the database      German-PM-W4   and have a look at how the specification is done      there.
