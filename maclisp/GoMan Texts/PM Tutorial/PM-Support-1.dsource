Their PHClass cantherefore be specified in the subtree (PHClass NP), i.e. in the same subtree asthe first PHClass. You are free to choose any node name for the new node, as long as it is afeature with the attribute "PHClass". We suggest that you choose - analogously to thenode name of the first PHClass - a name that is inspired by the syntacticalstructure of the PHClass. E.g.@Verbatim 	(PHClass Art+[N+Adj])@End-Verbatim This node is best introduced as a brother node of the first PHClass node:@ItemOpen the @Application-Link{ "Class window" | "Italian-PM-W2-class-button"} of Italian-PM-W2 and extend the class tree to its leave node @End-Item @ItemSelect the node (PHClass Art+[Adj+N]) by clicking it@End-Item @ItemChoose 'New Brother' in the @Application-Link{ "Edit" |"client-Edit-menu" } menu@End-Item @ItemType the node name into the dialogue box; the suggested node nameis:@Verbatim 	(PHClass Art+[N+Adj])@End-Verbatim@End-Item @ItemClick OK@End-Item The class window should now look like this (the new node is selected by us):@Figure{ "New Node (PHClass Art+[Adj+N])" | "129" | 300 | 330 } Go back to the PM-Tutorial for the next specification step.@Chapter{Specification of the PHClass}@Section{Syntax Tree}@Label{ "Help-3.1" }If it is not open yet, open the PHClass window by clicking the new node in the Classwindow of Italian-PM-W2.

Since none of the words in this phrase isallowed to inflect, the morphological restrictions should define eachword in the phrase unambiguously as one particular wordform.The morphological restriction are specified by means of the wordformfeatures defined in WM. To check these wordform features, you can type thewordforms into the Messages window or into the PM-Test window and selectthem one at a time.

So, on a new line underneath the example phrase, type:@Verbatim 		la	(Cat Art)(Cat Def)(Num SG)(Gen F)	pecora	(Cat N)(Gen F)(Num SG)	nera	(Cat Adj)(Manner Qual)(Num SG)(Gen F)@End-Verbatim The PHClass window should look like this, now:@Figure{ "Specification of Morphological Restrictions" | "134" | 404 | 338 }Finally, underneath the morphological restrictions, you have tospecify individual modifications, i.e. modifications that are only allowedwith this particular phrase. We have already specified a general modificationallowing the noun to be associated with “external” words on its left-handside (see above @Link{ "Modifications" | "Help-3.2" }). The example "la pecora" does not allow any other modification. So, @Itemtype ahyphen on a new line underneath the morphological restrictions and close thePHClass specification with a Newline @End-Item The Class window should now look like this:@Figure{ "(PHClass Art+[N+Adj])" | "135" | 407 | 338 }This is the complete specification of the second PHClass! Go back to the PM-Tutorial for the compilation.@Chapter{Compilation}@Label{ "Help-4" }To compile the database: @ItemChoose 'Run Compiler' or 'Compile All' in the@Application-Link{ "Phrase Manager Menu" | "Client-PM-Menu" }.
