@Chapter{Class Tree Specification}@Label{ "Help-1" }The German future tense is formed with the auxiliary "werden".Therefore, the PIClass defining the future is preferably added as a sonnode of the node (PIClass Auxiliary). We will call it (PIClass Future).@ItemOpen the @Application-Link{ "class window" |"German-PM-W3-class-button" } and extend the PIClass tree. @End-Item @ItemSelect the node (PIClass Perfect)@End-Item @ItemChoose 'New Brother' in the Edit menu@End-Item@ItemInto the dialogue box, type: @Verbatim (PIClass Future)@End-Verbatim @End-Item @ItemClick OK@End-Item @Figure{ "Class Tree with (PIClass Future)" | "128" | 270 | 265 } Of course, this is only a suggestion. Other names and other treestructures are possible. It is important, however, to choose node nameswith the attribute "PIClass" (Periphrastic Inflection Class). Go back to the tutorial for the specification of the syntax tree.@Chapter{Syntax Tree}@Label{ "Help-2" }The syntax tree of the future tense can be represented as follows:@Figure{ "Syntax Tree Future Tense" | "129" | 142 | 144 } In this form, the structure of the tree is identical to the tree of theperfect tense. Consequently, the linear representation of this tree isexactly the same as the syntax tree specification in the (PIClassPerfect). @ItemOpen the window (PIClass Future) by clicking the node in the Classwindow. Into the window type:@End-Item @Item@Verbatim SYNTAX-TREE@End-Verbatim @End-Item@ItemNewline@End-Item@Item@Verbatim (VP V V)@End-Verbatim @End-Item @Figure{ "Syntax Tree (PIClass Future)" | "130" | 352 | 220 } Go back to the tutorial for the specification of the next specificationstep (step 3). @Chapter{Modifications}@Label{ "Help-3" }In the window (PIClass Future), type:@ItemMODIFICATIONS@End-Item @ItemNewline@End-Item Modifications specify which words of a phrase may be associated with“external” words. In the future tense, external words can standbetween the two verb forms. There are different manners to expressthis:@Item@Verbatim V-1 >@End-Verbatim The first verb may be associated with external words on its right-handside. Digits are used when a syntax tree contains identical symbols.The above can also be expressed without a digit, since asymbol without a digit stands for the first symbol from the left: @Verbatim V >@End-Verbatim @End-Item @Item@Verbatim V-2 <@End-Verbatim The second verb may be associated with external words on its left-handside.@End-Item Type one of these possibilities on a new line underneath the subtitleMODIFICATIONS. We have chosen the specification without digit:@Figure{ "Modifications (PIClass Future)" | "131" | 352 | 221 } Go back to the tutorial for the fourth specification step.@Chapter{Transformations}@Label{ "Help-4" }The two verb-forms can be inverted. This is exactly the same syntacticaltransformation the two verb-forms of the perfect can be subject to.@Figure{ "Inversion Perfect and Future" | "132" | 305 | 336 }Transformation rules are not specified within the PIClass but in aseparate window 'Transformations'. There, they are specifiedtogether with a rule identifier. By means of these rule identifiers,you specify in the class window which transformation may be appliedon the class. As we have seen, the transformations allowed for the perfect and the future tensesare identical. Consequently, we can use the same rule identifier for both PIClasses,viz. "VV-Inversion".So, go into the window (PIClass Future) and type, on a new line:@Item@Verbatim TRANSFORMATIONS@End-Verbatim@End-Item@Item Newline @End-Item@Item@Verbatim VV-Inversion@End-Verbatim@End-Item @Figure{ "Transformations (PIClass Future)" | "133" | 352 | 223 } With this specification we indicate, that the transformation rule "VV-Inversion" isresponsible for the syntactical transformations regarding the future tense. Sincewe already have specified this transformation rule for the perfect tense, theindication of the rule identifier is sufficient. Nevertheless, have a look at the rule in the window @Application-Link{"Transformations" | "German-PM-W3-transf-button" } in order to remember how atransformation rule has to be specified. Go back to the tutorial for the fifth specification step.@Chapter{Periphrastic Inflection}@Label{ "Help-5" }Like transformations, periphrastic inflection rules are not specifiedwithin the PIClass definition. They are formalized in a separate windowtogether with a PI-rule identifier. By means of these rule identifiers,you specify in the PIClass window which PI-rules are responsible forthe class.For the periphrastic inflection rule responsible for the German futuretense we suggest an easily intelligible name like "Auxiliary-Future".So, go into the window (PIClass Future). On a new line, under thespecification of the Transformations, type: @Item@Verbatim PERIPHR-INFL@End-Verbatim@End-Item@ItemNewline@End-Item@Item@Verbatim Auxiliary-Future@End-Verbatim @End-Item@ItemNewline@End-Item @Figure{ "Periphrastic Inflection (PIClass Future)" | "134" | 387 | 309 }Go back to the tutorial for the example specification (step 6).@Chapter{Example}@Label{ "Help-6" }@Section{Example Phrase}The example phrase for the German future tense is quite simple. The verb"werden" is combined with an infinitive.In the window (PIClass Future), on a new line, type@Item@Verbatim EXAMPLE@End-Verbatim@End-Item  @ItemNewline@End-Item @Item@Verbatim <werden>@End-VerbatimThe pointed brackets indicate that "werden" may be inflected.@End-Item@ItemWhite Space (or Tab)@End-Item @Item@Verbatim inf@End-Verbatim"inf" stands for "infinitive". It is a keyword that you will have to specify ina separate window. Of course, you can choose another keywordfor the infinitive. However, it must not be homographic with anywordform likely ever to be stored in the database.@End-Item @ItemNewline@End-Item The example specification@Verbatim <werden> inf@End-Verbatim says, that an inflected wordform of the lexeme "werden" and a pastparticiple are combined to form an entity. @Section{Keyword Specification}@Label{ "keyword" }To indicate the infinitive, you used the keyword "inf" (or, perhaps, anotherone). Keywords are simple identifiers representing feature sets. Thespecification of keywords takes place in the window 'Keywords'. @ItemClick the @Application-Link{ "keywords button" |"German-PM-W3-keywords-button" } in the document window to open thewindow. @End-Item The window already contains the keyword "pp" that we have specified forthe (PIClass Perfect).

You can check thisby opening the lexical browser of any verb ("haben", "schlagen", "gehen", etc.).@Figure{ "Keyword Specification “inf”" | "135" | 403 | 163 }After the specification of the keyword, close the windowKey-Words and go back to the (PIClass Future) @Section{Morphological Restrictions}There are two elements in the example phrase: "<werden>" and "inf". @Item "werden" may be inflected. To what extend is not relevant here, as we willsee with the specification of the periphrastic inflection rule. So, type on a newline, underneath the example phrase:@Verbatim werden   (Cat V)@End-Verbatim @End-Item @ItemThe keyword "inf" is already specified as a wordform with the feature set (CatV)(Mod Inf)(Temp Pres) (cf. @Link{ "previoussection" | "keyword" }). No more indications are needed. When a keyworddoes not require further restrictions - as it is the case here - you do nothave to specify any morphological restrictions. @End-Item Finally, do not forget, that every example must be closed by the indication ofindividual modifications. There are none. @ItemType a hyphen "-", on a new line.@End-Item @Figure{ "Example Specification (PIClass Future)" | "136" | 386 | 312}Go back to the tutorial for the specification of the periphrastic inflectionrule (step 7). @Chapter{Periphrastic Inflection Rule}@Label{ "Help-7" }@ItemOpen the window Periphrastic-Inflections by clicking the @Application-Link{"periphr" | "German-PM-W3-periphr-button" } button in the documentwindow. @End-Item @ItemIn the window, on a new line, type the rule identifier you have chosen. We have suggested thefollowing @Verbatim Auxiliary-Future@End-Verbatim @End-Item The actual PIRule is specified under this title. A PIRule consists of twoparts separated by an equals sign. On the left-hand side, you specify which wordforms of the lexemes specified in thePIClass form the cluster.For the German future, the wordforms of the indicative present (Mod Ind)(Temp Pres) of "werden" are combined with an infinitive. So,type: @ItemNewline@End-Item @Item@Verbatim (Cat V)(Mod Ind)(Temp Pres) + inf@End-Verbatim The wordforms of the present are qualified by these features;  we have alreadydefined the keyword "inf" for the infinitive (cf. @Link{ "KeywordSpecification" | "keyword" })@End-Item  @Itemone or more White Spaces (or Tabs), then the equals sign "=".@End-Item On the right-hand side of the equals sign, you specify some characteristics of thecombined periphrastic inflection cluster:@Itemone or more White Spaces (or Tabs)@End-Item @ItemPosition of the cluster in an analyzed phrase: The position of the cluster in a phrase mustbe the same as the position of the first element (1) on the left-hand side, i.e. theposition of the future tense in an analyzed phrase is the same as the position of theauxiliary. For example, the sentences@Verbatim 	er WIRD den Hund SCHLAGEN	sie WIRD nach Hause GEHEN@End-Verbatim will be analyzed as@Verbatim 	er WIRD SCHLAGEN den Hund	sie WIRD GEHEN nach Hause @End-VerbatimCompare these sentences with the following  (in the present tense):@Verbatim 	er SCHLÄGT den Hund	sie GEHT nach Hause @End-Verbatim Therefore type: @Verbatim (POS 1)@End-Verbatim @End-Item@ItemThe citation form of the lexeme the cluster belongs to: The wordforms of the future belongto the lexeme of the infinitive (2), not to the auxiliary "werden" (1).

If this is the case, correctthe error and try to compile the PM-specification again.If you do not succeed in detecting and correcting the error, we suggest that youclose the database German-PM-W3 WITHOUT saving it. Then, go back in the Tutorial and tryit once again. @Document-Link{ "Go back" | "PM Tutorial:PM-Tutorial" |"2nd-periphrastic-class" }. If that does not work either, you can open the database  @Application-Link{"German-PM-W4" | "German-PM-W4" } to compare it with your specification. It is analready compiled copy of the specification we described for German-PM-W3. ----------------------------------------------------------When the database is successfully compiled, you can test the PIClassspecification:@ItemOpen the 'Message' or the PM-Test window by clicking the correspondingbutton in the document window of the database.@End-Item @ItemType the examples given below into the window@End-Item @ItemSelect them one by one (e.g. with a triple-click)@End-Item @ItemChoose 'Recognize' in the @Application-Link{ "PhraseManager Menu" |"Client-PM-Menu" } (or type CTRL+K)@End-Item @ItemCompare the results of the retrieve with the comments to theexamples below.@End-Item ***1) @Verbatim ich werde gehen	@End-Verbatim 'I will/shall go'Must be recognized as wordform in the future tense of "gehen":Note the indication of the periphrastic inflection in the last text field of the retrievaldialog. ***2)@Verbatim  er wird schlagen	@End-Verbatim 'he will beat'Must be recognized as wordform of "schlagen" with the features @Verbatim (Cat V)(Mod Ind)(Temp Fut)(Pers 3rd)(Num SG) @End-Verbatim ***3)@Verbatim  du wirst alt sein		@End-Verbatim lit.  'you will be old' "wirst sein" must be recognized as 2nd person singular future tense of"sein". The first verb form may be associated with external words (here:"alt") on its right-hand side. Cf. @Link{ "Modifications" | "Help-3" }***4)@Verbatim  wir werden diesen menschen kennen			@End-Verbatim 'we shall/will known this person' "werden kennen" must be recognized as future tense of "kennen"(modifications; cf. 3). Note that "werden kennen" can be the 1st and the 3rdperson plural. This, because in these two persons of the present indicative"werden" is ambiguous. This ambiguity is correctly percolated on theperiphrastic cluster.***5)@Verbatim 	dass du gehen wirst 		'that you will go'	dass wir schlagen werden	'that we shall/will beat'@End-Verbatim Must be recognized as wordforms of "gehen" and "schlagen", respectively.In subordinate clauses like these, the word order in the future cluster isinverted. Therefore, inversion must be allowed; cf. @Link{"Transformations" | "Help-4" }***6) As a last test, we can take the example of the first PHClass ("in das grasbeissen"):@Verbatim 	er wird ins gras beissen	dass er ins gras beissen wird@End-Verbatim '(that) he will bite into the grass' = 'he will kick the bucket' In both sentences (main and subordinate clause), "wird beissen" must berecognized as the 3rd person singular future tense of "beissen".  Note the positionof the cluster in the analyzed sentence.********** When the results of the retrieves are as described, the specification ofthe  PIClass is correct. If not, check your specification thoroughly.If you do not succeed in detecting and correcting the error, we suggest that youclose the database German-PM-W3 WITHOUT saving it. Then, try it once again.@Document-Link{ "Go back" | "PM Tutorial:PM-Tutorial" |"2nd-periphrastic-class"}. If that does not work either, you can open the database  @Application-Link{"German-PM-W4" | "German-PM-W4" } and have a look at how the specification is donethere.
