          1. Syntax tree           The expressions are noun phrases composed of an article and a      noun phrase consisting of a noun and an adjective:      Figure 1.1 Syntax Tree “la pecora nera”     Go back to the PM-Tutorial for the next specification step.      2. Class Tree           The expression of the "la pecora nera " type are noun phrases.      Their PHClass can therefore be specified in the subtree (PHClass      NP), i.e. in the same subtree as the first PHClass.      You are free to choose any node name for the new node, as long as      it is a feature with the attribute "PHClass ". We suggest that you      choose - analogously to the node name of the first PHClass - a      name that is inspired by the syntactical structure of the      PHClass. E.g.      	(PHClass Art+[N+Adj])     This node is best introduced as a brother node of the first      PHClass node:         •  Open the Class window   of Italian-PM-W2 and extend             the class tree to its leave node         •  Select the node (PHClass Art+[Adj+N]) by clicking it         •  Choose 'New Brother' in the Edit   menu         •  Type the node name into the dialogue box; the suggested             node name is: 	(PHClass Art+[N+Adj])        •  Click OK      The class window should now look like this (the new node is      selected by us):      Figure 2.1 New Node (PHClass Art+[Adj+N])     Go back to the PM-Tutorial for the next specification step.      3. Specification of the PHClass           3.1. Syntax Tree           If it is not open yet, open the PHClass window by clicking the      new node in the Class window of Italian-PM-W2. Then, type:         •  SYNTAX-TREE        •  Newline         •  (NP Art (NP N Adj))        •  Newline      Remember that         •  in the linear notation of the syntax tree used in PM, one             pair of brackets encloses one parent node and its direct             son nodes (cf. figure “Syntax Tree Notation” in section             Syntax Tree   ).         •  with the symbols representing morphological             categories, you must verify that the symbol you use for             a certain category actually corresponds to the symbol             used in WM for the same category (in Italian-PM-W2: "N             " for nouns, "Art " for articles, "Adj " for adjectives)      The PHClass window should now look as follows:      Figure 3.1 Specification of Syntax-Tree     Go back to the PM-Tutorial for the next specification step.      3.2. Modifications           Under modifications, you specify how the phrase can be modified      by "external " words. External words are words that can be added      within the phrase without damaging its idiosyncratic meaning (=      discontinuity).         •  Type 		MODIFICATIONS            on a new line underneath the syntax-tree specification             in the PHClass window (PHClass Art+[N+Adj).      In this PHClass, the noun can be associated with external words      on its left-hand side.         •  Type             N <             on a new line underneath the title MODIFICATIONS. The             Symbol "N " and the modification character "< " are             separated by a White Space.      This means that the noun can have one or more external words on      its left-hand side.      The PHClass window should now look like this:      Figure 3.2 Specification of Modifications      Go back to the PM-Tutorial for the next specification step.      3.3. Transformations           No syntactical transformations are allowed. So, type:         •  Newline         •  TRANSFORMATIONS        •  Newline         •  Hyphen "- "         •  Newline      The PHClass window should now look like this:      Figure 3.3 Specification of Transformations     Go back to the PM-Tutorial for the next specification step.      3.4. Example           First, you have to specify the example phrase:      On a new line underneath the Transformations in the PHClass      window (PHClass Art+[N+Adj]), type:         •  EXAMPLE        •  Newline         •  la pecora nera        •  Newline      The PHClass window should look like this:      Figure 3.4 Specification of Example Phrase     Then, you have to specify the morphological restrictions, i.e. the      wordform features of each word of the phrase. Since none of the      words in this phrase is allowed to inflect, the morphological      restrictions should define each word in the phrase      unambiguously as one particular wordform.      The morphological restriction are specified by means of the      wordform features defined in WM. To check these wordform      features, you can type the wordforms into the Messages window      or into the PM-Test window and select them one at a time. When      a wordform is selected, you         •  either open the lexical browser (press CTRL+L) and             search for the relevant wordform features to type them             over into the PHClass window         •  or choose 'Recognize' in the Phrase Manager menu (press             CTRL+K) and type over the relevant wordform features             from the window 'Words' of the Retrieval Dialog.      In the morphological restrictions, each word stands on a new      line followed by its wordform features. So, on a new line      underneath the example phrase, type:      		la	(Cat Art)(Cat Def)(Num SG)(Gen F)	pecora	(Cat N)(Gen F)(Num SG)	nera	(Cat Adj)(Manner Qual)(Num SG)(Gen F)          The PHClass window should look like this, now:      Figure 3.5 Specification of Morphological Restrictions     Finally, underneath the morphological restrictions, you have to      specify individual modifications, i.e. modifications that are only      allowed with this particular phrase. We have already specified a      general modification allowing the noun to be associated with      “external” words on its left-hand side (see above Modifications        ).      The example "la pecora " does not allow any other modification.      So,         •  type a hyphen on a new line underneath the             morphological restrictions and close the PHClass             specification with a Newline      The Class window should now look like this:      Figure 3.6 (PHClass Art+[N+Adj])     This is the complete specification of the second PHClass!      Go back to the PM-Tutorial for the compilation.      4. Compilation           To compile the database:         •  Choose 'Run Compiler' or 'Compile All' in the Phrase             Manager Menu   . The commands are only available when             a database is selected.         •  Click OK in the dialog box.      If you have carried out all specification steps correctly, the      following message will be displayed in the message window:       > PM Compilation ok. It took ... seconds.     If you have made any mistakes, the system will warn you with an      acoustic signal and an error message. If this is the case, try to      correct the error.      Some hints:         •  When this error message is displayed,             	error: Cannot find a match between the syntax-tree	of the referred rule and the defined phrase                        you have probably made a mistake in the specification             of the syntax tree or the morphological restrictions. Cf.             Syntax Tree   and/or Morphological Restriction under             Example   specification         •  When this error message is displayed,             error: Title expected            and nothing is selected in the PHClass window, you have             probably forgotten to specify a hyphen at the end of the             specification. The hyphen indicates that no individual             modificationss are allowed. Cf. end of Example               specification.      If you do not succeed in detecting and correcting the error, we      suggest that you close the database Italian-PM-W2 WITHOUT      saving it. Then, try it once again. Go back   .      If that does not work either, you can open the database      Italian-PM-W3   and have a look at how the specification is done      there.      5. Checking the specification           To check the specification of the second PHClass:         •  Open the Messages window or the PM-test window of             the Italian-PM database you are currently in.         •  Type the phrase "la pecora nera "         •  Select the phrase (e.g. by a triple click)         •  Choose 'Recognize' in the 'PhraseManager' menu      If the specification has been done correctly, the Retrieval Dialog      displays in its first text field the analysed phrase, in its second      textfield the minimal form of the expression (here, the analysed      phrase and the minimal form of the expression are identical):      Figure 5.1 Retrieval Dialog “la pecora nera”     ----------------------------------------------------------      If, however, the result of the phrase analysis is different from      what the above figure shows, you have probably made a mistake      somewhere. The indication next to the title 'Retrieved forms'      	No matched idioms      means that the analysed sentence has not been recognized as the      idiomatic expression you have tried to specify. Check your      specification in Italian-PM-W2; especially the morphological      restrictions in the Example specification (see figure      'Specification of Morphological Restrictions' under Example   ).      ----------------------------------------------------------      The sentence has been recognized as an idiomatic expression.      Now, you can test other utterances. Copy them into the Messages      or the PM-Test window and have them analysed (select them and      press CTRL+K).         •  le pecore nere            Plural of "la pecora nera "; should not be recognized as             an utterance of the idiom "la pecora nera ". The             wordforms of the idiom are not allowed to inflect.         •  la vera pecora nera            'the real black sheep'; should be recognized as idiomatic             expression. The noun may have “external words” on its             left-hand side.         •  la nera pecora            inversion of noun and adjective; should not be             recognized as idiomatic expression. No syntactical             transformations are allowed for the idiom.         •  la pecora molto nera            'the very black sheep'; should not be recognized as             idiomatic expression. “External” words are not allowed             on the right-hand side of the noun nor on the left-hand             side of the adjective.      When the results of the retrieves are as described, the      specification of the first PHClass is correct. If not, check your      specification thoroughly.      If you do not succeed in detecting and correcting the error, we      suggest that you close the database Italian-PM-W2 WITHOUT      saving it. Then, try it once again. Go back   .      If that does not work either, you can open the database      Italian-PM-W3   and have a look at how the specification is done      there.
