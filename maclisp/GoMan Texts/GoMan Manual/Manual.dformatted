          1. Introduction      The goal of the system GoMan (Generic Online MANual) is to give      the user comfortable access to the informations in a document.      The indented document types are online manuals or general      descriptions of applications written in MCL.      To achieve this main goal GoMan has to meet several      requirements:         ¥  The reader of a document should be able to navigate in a             document without any training-phase and without any             additional mental effort. It should be possible to see             both the application, the user is working with, and the             document with the description of the application. The             interchange between the application and the description             should be as simple as possible. (See chapter The             Reader's View   ).         ¥  The author of a document should be able to center on his             main task of writing the text. Work on the layout of the             document has to be minimized and the author's support             maximized. (See chapter The Author's View   ).         ¥  The programmer of a specific MCL-application should to             able to establish a connection between a document and             an application with minimal programming effort. So a             context sensitive help can be added to a existing             application without changing the application             substantially. (See chapter The Programmer's View   ).           2. The Reader's View           2.1. What is a Document?           2.2. How to Enter a Specific Document      There are several ways to enter a specific document:         ¥  via a link from a application         ¥  via a link from another document         ¥  via direct access           2.3.
