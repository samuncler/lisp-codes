@Chapter{From Linguistic Data to Word Manager Entities}@Label{ "Help 1" } The paradigm is:@Verbatim 	Sing: giorn-o	Plur: giorn-i@End-Verbatim The nouns of the o/i-class are regular nouns. They belong to the same inflection unit as the nouns of the a/e-class. Therefore, their Inflection Rule is situated in the same subtree at the same level as the (RIRule a/e).The formatives to be specified are: one stem, a singular suffix and a plural suffix.The rule should generate two wordforms: a singular form (stem + singular suffix "o") and a plural form (stem + plural suffix "i"). Thecitation form is the singular. The stem of the o/i-class is an underspecified Inflection Formative,the suffixes are fully specified Inflection Formatives. @Chapter{Specification of Formatives} @Label{ "Help 2" } The stem and the suffixesto be specified are of the same kind and used in the same subtree as the onesspecified for the a/e-class. Therefore, they can be defined in the same formativewindows, i.e. the window (ICat N-Stem) and the window (ICat N-Suffix),repectively). So, open the inflection window by clicking @Application-Link{"inflection button" | "Italian-Work.1-inflection-button" } in the document windowof Italian-Work.1. As you will see, the inflection tree is collapsed until the first level(Cat N). This is done automatically by the system every time a databaseis closed and reopened. Nodes with underlying collapsed subtrees arerepresented in bold. The tree can be expanded by selecting a bold node ansubsequently choosing the command 'Expand/Collapse' in the Edit menu.So, after you have opened the database Italian-Work.1 and opened itsInflection window: @Item	select the node (Cat N),@End-Item @Item	choose 'Expand/Collapse' in the @Application-Link{ "Edit menu" |	"Client-Edit-menu" } (or type CTRL+E), @End-Item @Item	select the node (ICat Regular) which is displayed in bold, too,@End-Item @Item	choose 'Expand/Collapse' in the Edit menu (or type CTRL+E).@End-Item The tree is now fully extended (there are no nodes represented in boldleft). @SubSection{Fully specified IFormatives}The suffixes are to be specified as fully specified Inflection Formatives, preferably in the already existing formative window (ICat N-Suffix).Open the formative window by double-clicking the node (ICatN-Suffix) in the @Application-Link{ "Inflection Window" |"Italian-Work.1: INFLECTION" }. Add the two suffixes "o" and "i" in exactlythe same manner as the suffixes "a" and "e", i.e.:lexical string, white space, surface string, tab(s), feature set, newline.Even though the feature set of every formative should be unique, try tore-use as many as possible of the already specified features. After thespecification of the two new suffixes, the formative window (ICatN-Suffix) could look like this: @Figure{ "Underspecified IFormatives (ICatN-Suffix)" | "129" | 382 | 192 } @SubSection{Underspecified IFormatives}The stem of the o/i-class must be specified as an underspecified IFormative, preferably in the same formative window as the already specified noun stem.Open the formative window by double-clicking the node (ICat N-Stem) in the Inflection Window and specify the new stem like thea/e-stem, i.e.:underscore, tab, feature(s), newline. As always, try to use feature values that can easily be interpreted. Forthe stem in question, we suggest something like (ICat o/i): @Figure{ "fully specified IFormative (ICat N-Stem)" | "130" | 357 | 176 }@Chapter{Create a new Inflection Rule node}@Label{ "Help 3" } The o/i-class is a regularly inflection noun class just like thea/e-class. Therefore, the Inflection Rule should be specified in thesame inflection unit as the (RIRule a/e). You can choose to add the new rule node either as a new son of the node (ICatRegular) or as a new brother of the node (RIRule a/e). For the specification, itdoesn’t make any difference, as long as the two IRules are specified on the sametree level. In the example, the new node will be added as a new brother of (RIRulea/e). To add the new node: @ItemSelect the node (RIRule a/e) in the InflectionWindow@End-Item @ItemChoose New Brother in the Edit menu@End-Item @Item Type a node name in the textfield of the displayed dialoguewindow. This has to be a bracketed attribute-value pair. Since you aregoing to specify a regular inflection rule, the attribute must be "RIRule".You are free to choose any value. We suggest "o/i" => You type "RIRule o/i"between the brackets in the the textfield of the dialogue box. @End-Item @ItemWhen the node name is correct, click the OK-button.@End-Item The Inflection Window should now look like this (new node name white onblack because selected by us): @Figure{ "Inflection Window" | "131" | 257 | 287 } @Chapter{Specification of the Inflection Rule}@Label{ "Help 4" }Open the rule window by double-clicking the new node (RIRule o/i) in theInflection Window. The subparts of the inflection rule are"citation-forms", "word-forms", optionally "paradigms" and, finally,at least one "entry".@Itemcitation-forms: We use the wordfrom of the singular as citation form.The singular consist of the noun stem and the singular suffix.

Cf. @Document-Link {"Individually Added Features" | "GoMan Texts:Tutorial;Tutorial" |"Individually Added Features" } in the Tutorial. "giorno" is a masculine noun. In accordance with the alreadyspecified gender feature (Gender Fem), the masculine featurecould be (Gender Masc). Type it on the same line as the keyword"entry", separated from it by a tab: @Verbatimentry	(Gender M)		"giorn" "giorn"@End-Verbatim @End-ItemTo sum up, this is how your inflection rule could look like:@Figure{ "Inflection Rule (RIRule o/i)" | "133" | 427 | 224 }@Chapter{Check Syntax}@Label{ "Help 5" }To check the syntax of the whole Inflection Window, select it and choose "Check Syntax" in the WordManager menu (or press Ctrl+T). For the syntax of single windowsof any kind, open the window and choose Check Syntax while the window is selected.If you have made a syntax error, the system warns you with an acoustic signaland displays an error message in the message window. Together with the error message, the corresponding node or window are shown, so that,usually, it is quite easy to detect the error and to correct it.After correction, redo the Syntax check until there are no syntax errorsleft. If you do not succeed in detecting the syntax error the system wants you tocorrect, you can try the following: @ItemDelete the new node - and only the new node! - (select it and choose"Cut Subtree" in the Edit menu) as well as the specification of thenew formatives in the formative windows, i.e. delete everything youspecified yourself in the database Italian-Work.1. Then, retry the specification. @End-Item@Item If that doesn’t work either, close the database Italian-Work.1(select its document window and choose 'Close' in the File menu) WITHOUT! saving itan restart at the beginning of the section of the Tutorial you are presently workingin. @End-ItemIf you haven’t made any syntax errors, or after you have corrected themall, a dialogue window asks you whether or not the newly introducedfatures must be added to Feature Domains. Check the list for typing mistakes. E.g. (Gemder N) instead of (Gender M), (Rirule o/i)instead of (RIRule o/i), etc. If there is a typing error, click "cancel", correct it in theInflection Window and redo Check Syntax. To correct a node name, select it in the Inflection window, choosethe 'Edit Node Name' command in the File menu and correct it in the appearingdialogue box. Then, redo the syntax check. When you agree with the list, select all features (click themone by one while holding down the Shift-key) and click OK. The features will be added toFeature Domains. @Chapter{The Compilation} @Label{ "Help 6" } @ItemChoose "Compile All" in the WordManager Menu@End-Item@ItemIn the dialogue window, select"monitor entries" if it is not already on@End-Item @ItemClick OK@End-Item If there are no mistakes, the compilation will be carried out successfully.
