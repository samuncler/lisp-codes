@Chapter{Interpretation of the data}@Label{ "Help-1" }The vowels "a", "o" and "u" in stems of wordforms of the singular canbe "ä", "ö" and "ü", respectively, in the wordforms of the plural. If we take the stem of the singular as basis, the modificationtakes place when the stem is combined with a plural suffix. Thevowel "a" is changed into "ä", "o" into "ö" and "u" into "ü". The rest ofthe string remains unaltered.The way we have stated the problem here, these modifications are notformally (inflection class, gender, phonetic context, etc.) predictible.Therefore, the difference between nouns with umlaut and thosewithout umlaut has to be indicated at the level of the specificationof individual entries. One method to do this, is the introduction ofspecial characters to be used in the specification of the lexicalstring  of the stems. Cf. @Document-Link{ "Introduction of SpecialLexical Characters" | "GoMan Texts:Tutorial;Tutorial" |"Special-Lexical-Characters" }. @Chapter{Formulation of Spelling Rules}@Label{ "Help-2" }As a distinction between stems that are umlauted and those that arenot, you can introduce special lecical characters: the lexical stringsof stems with umlaut are written with "A", "O" or "U". Stems withoutumlaut are written with the regular characters "a", "o" and "u". E.g.:"luchs" vs "fUchs" "kabel" vs "schnAbel". Then, the definition of a noun stem with an "u" that is umlauted lookslike this:@Verbatim".*U.*" (ICat N-Stem)@End-Verbatim This "U" has to be replaced by an "ü" (whereas the rest of the string is to berewritten withou any modification): @Verbatim"(.*)U(.*)/\1ü\2" (ICat N-Stem)@End-Verbatim when it is combined with a plural suffix: @Verbatim"(.*)U(.*)/\1ü\2" (ICat N-Stem)	(ICat N-Suffix)(Num PL)@End-Verbatim Example: "(f)U(chs)/füchs" + "e" (Num PL) => "füchse" A possible name to complete the rule could be the following @Verbatim (ISRule N_Umlaut_U)"(.*)U(.*)/\1ü\2" (ICat N-Stem)	(ICat N-Suffix)(Num PL)@End-Verbatim In this form, it can be specified in the Spelling Rule window (clickbutton @Application-Link{ "Spelling" | "German-Work-spelling-button" } in thedocument window of "German-Work" to open it). The Spelling window alreadycontains some Inflection Spelling Rules. Add the new one underneath them, in thesame Spelling Rule Group. The group is initiated by the feature (Cat N). All theSpelling Rules specified underneath it with an indent of one tab are applied onentries in the subtree (Cat N) only. Indeed, the umlaut-rules, as weformulate them here, must be applied on nouns, only.This first ISRule controls the U/ü umlaut. For the other two cases, two moreISRules have to be written. They look exactly the same, with the exception, ofcourse of the corresponding vowels. You can copy them into the Spelling Rulewindow of "German.Work". They belong to the same spelling rule group, so don’tforget to indent them with one tab: @Verbatim (ISRule N_Umlaut_A)"(.*)A(.*)/\1ä\2" (ICat N-Stem)	(ICat N-Suffix)(Num PL)@End-Verbatim @Verbatim (ISRule N_Umlaut_O)"(.*)O(.*)/\1ö\2" (ICat N-Stem)	(ICat N-Suffix)(Num PL)@End-Verbatim In this manner, we have formalized the umlaut phenomenon in theregular German noun inflection. In the plural forms, the stems withthe special characters "A", "O", "U" are replaced by stems with thecorresponding umlaut, whereas stems with the regular characters "a","o", "u" remain unaltered. Still, the special characters have to be replaced by the correct (lowercase) surface characters in the wordforms of the singular. These arepossible Spelling Rules:@Verbatim 	(ISRule Replace_A/a)	"(.*)A(.*)/\1a\2"	(ISRule Replace_O/o)	"(.*)O(.*)/\1o\2"	(ISRule Replace_U/u)	"(.*)U(.*)/\1u\2"@End-Verbatim Note that it is not necessary to restrict any further on which kind ofstrings these rules must be applied (but: you are free to add possiblerestrictions, of course). As long as the "Replace" rules are specifiedafter "Umlaut" rules, only the not umlauted wordforms still have thespecial characters. The input to the "Replace" rules contains only thewordforms in which the special characters must be replaced by theregular surface character. In the plural forms, they have already beenreplaced by the "Umlaut" rules. So, make sure, that the "Replace"rules are specified after the "Umlaut" rules.The Spelling Rules in the Spelling Rule window could look like this:@Figure{ "Spelling Rule window: Umlaut rules" | "128" | 489 | 329 }@Chapter{Declaration of New Lexical Characters} @Label{ "Help-3" }Open the window Lexical Character Set by clicking the @Application-Link{ "lexchar button" | "German-Work-lex char-button" } in the Document Window of"German-Work". The new special lexical characters to be declared are "A", "O" and "U".They stand for the surface characters "a", "o", and "u". Therefore, theformer have to be declared on the same line as the latter in thecharacter sort order. In the German alphabetic sort order, the umlaut is traditionallytreated as the simple character. In two otherwise identical strings,the string with the simple character comes first (e.g. “bar” 'cash'before “Bär” 'bear'). Therefore, the umlaut characters have beenspecified on the same line as the simple characters, but after them.Since our new special lexical characters stand for simple characters,you have to insert them before the umlaut characters (bold is ours): @Figure{ "Lexical Character Set With “A”, “O”, “U”" | "131" | 232 | 386} @Chapter{Specification of New  Hard Coded Entries}@Label{ "Help-4" }The entries given in the text are: (RIRule ES/E): "brot", "floss" (both gender neuter), "luchs", "fuchs" (bothgender masculine) (RIRule S/-): "kabel" (gender neuter), "schnabel" (gender masculine)To make an entry in one of these Inflection Rules, you have to specifythe strings of the noun stem ((ICat N-Stem) = underspecifiedIFormative) and, preferably, the corresponding gender feature.Open the corresponding Rule window by double-klicking the node in the Inflectionwindow, then add the entries. For example, in the (RIRule ES/E):@Verbatim    entry	(Gender N)   		"brot" "brot"@End-Verbatim "brot" is a noun without umlaut in the plural. For nouns with umlaut,you have to specify the lexical string with the special lexicalcharacters: "flOss". Don’t forget to specify two surface strings: onewith the simple character and one with the umlaut character:@Verbatim    entry	(Gender N)   		"flOss" "floss" "flöss"@End-Verbatim Add the other examples in the same way. This is how the entries inthe two modified IRules should look like:@Figure{ "Entries in (RIRule ES/E)" | "130" | 337 | 405 }@Figure{ "Entries in (RIRule S/-)" | "129" | 340 | 406 }@Chapter{Check Syntax}@Label{ "Help-5" }To check the syntax of the whole Inflection Window, select it and choose "Check Syntax" in the WordManager menu (or press Ctrl+T). For syntax of single windows of any kind (e.g.the Spelling Rule window), open the window and choose Check Syntax while the window isselected. If you have made a syntax error, the system warns you with an acoustic signaland displays an error message in the message window. Together with the error message, the corresponding node or window are shown, so that,usually, it is quite easy to see and to correct the error. Aftercorrection, redo the Syntax check until there are no syntax errorsleft. Note: During the syntax check in the Spelling Rule window thefollowing error message can be given @Figure{ "message error" | "132" | 442 | 187 }Check if you havent forgotten to close the brackets at the point thesystem indicates. If however, the system emphazises a character in anode name, you probably have chosen "ä", "ö" or "ü". If this is thecase, change the character into an so-called @Document-Link{ "alphabeticcharacter" | "Help:WM-Help" | "alphabetic-character" }. Note that only alphabeticcharacters are allowed in ISRule names. If you do not succeed in detecting the syntax error the system wantsyou to correct, you can try the following: Delete everything youspecified yourself (ISRules connected with umlaut, entries etc). Then,retry the specification. If that doesn’t work either, close the database German-Work ('Close' in the Filemenu) WITHOUT!! saving it an restart at the beginning of the section of the Tutorialyou are presently working in. If you haven’t made any syntax errors, or after you have correctedthem all, a dialogue window asks you whether or not the newlyintroduced fatures must be added to Feature Domains. Check the listfor typing mistakes. E.g. (Gemder N) instead of (Gender M), (IsruleReplace_A/a) instead of (ISRule Replace_A/a), etc. If there is atyping error, click "cancel", correct it in the corresponding windowand redo Check Syntax. When you agree with the list in the syntax check dialogue box, selectall features (click them one by one while holding down the Shift-key)and click OK. The features will be added to Feature Domains. @Chapter{The Compilation} @Label{ "Help-6" } Choose "Compile All" in the WordManager Menu. In the dialogue window, select"monitor entries" if it is not already on. Then, click OK. Ifthere are no mistakes, the compilation will be carried out successfully. If not, anacoustic signal and an error message in the message window will warn you. Correctthe mistake and redo "Compile All". If you do not understand the error message, check the following possible errors: @ItemAre the Spelling Rules correctly formulated?
