Thecharacter sequence sort order subwindow allows the specification of such exceptionalordering conventions.For German, a possible specification would be the following:@Example{Character Sequence Sort Order German}@Verbatim 	Ae Ä ae ä	Oe Ö oe ö	Ue Ü ue ü	ss ß@End-Verbatim@End-Example The elements to be specified may either be single characters orsequences of two characters.The elements on one line define one group of characters and character sequences.All the characters and character sequences on the same line are treated as if theywere identical to the first character sequence specified on the line. @Chapter{Character Sort Order}@Index{character sort order}@Label{ "character-sort-order" }In the windows @Link{ "Surface Character Set" | "surface-character-set" }and @Link{ "Lexical Character Set" | "lexical-character-set" }, the CharacterSort Order lists the characters in alphabetical order.

It starts with a semicolon (;), either on a new line or onthe same line as the specification text, separated from it by a space.The semicolons can be manually typed in or automatically insertedwith the 'Insert ";"' command in the Edit menu. The command insertsthree semicolons on each new line of selected text. In principle, only @Link{ "alphabetic characters" |"alphabetic-character" }, spaces, tabs and full-stops are allowed incomments. (The reason for this restriction is, that comments are disregarded completely by thesystem so that the transformations applied to system characters inorder to guarantee portability, does not see comments). @Chapter{Compilation}@Index{compilation}@Label{ "compilation"}The compilation transforms the contents of the database as specifiedby the linguist into an internal format.

It helps to avoidsuperfluous material in the database. The extensive testing takes extratime. Therefore, it is not recommended to have this option constantlyon in larger databases.@End-Item@End-Item @ItemClick 'OK' to initiate the compilation or 'Cancel' to cancel it.@End-ItemThe system will compile (part of) the database. When it is successfullyconcluded, the following message is given in the message window: @Verbatim compilation took ... seconds @End-Verbatim If there are syntax errors, errors in the organization of theinflection or the wordformation tree, etc. the compilation isinterrupted and an error message is given in the @Link{ "message window" |"message-window" }. When this is the case, correct the error and restart thecompilation with the 'Run Compiler' command. We suggest that you always do a @Link{ "syntax check" | "syntax-check" } beforeinitiating a compilation.

A feature restriction matchesall formatives for which the features defined in the restrictions are a subsetof the qualifying feature set. E.g. @Itemthe restriction @Verbatim (Cat N) @End-Verbatim  matches all formativescontaining this feature in their feature set.@End-Item@Item the restriction @Verbatim (Cat N)(ICat N-Stem)(ICat Regular)@End-Verbatim matches all formatives defined by this feature set. @End-ItemPositive restrictions are formulated like the two examples above by stating afeature or a feature set. Further possibilities are:@Item@Verbatim ^	e.g. (Cat N)(ICat N-Stem)^(ICat Irregular)@End-Verbatim Negative restrictions are introduced by "^". The example restriction matches allformatives qualified by the feature set (Cat N)(ICat N-Stem), except theformatives that are further specified by the feature (ICat Irregular) => all butthe irregular noun stems.@End-Item@Item@Verbatim |	e.g.	(Cat A-Stem)|(ICat N-Stem)		(ICat N-Stem)(ICat a/e)|(ICat N-Stem)(o/i)@End-Verbatim Alternatives are indicated by "|" (vertical dash). The first example restrictionmatches with all formatives that are specified by either the feature (ICatA-Stem) or the feature (ICat N-Stem) => all adjective and noun stems.The second example matches either noun stems that are specified by thefeature (ICat a/e) or noun stems that are specified by the feature (ICat o/i). The"or"-operator separates whole feature expressions. Consequently, the feature(ICat N-Stem)  has to be repeated for the second feature expression. @End-ItemCombinations of the "or" and "not" operators are possible:@Verbatim 	(ICat N-Stem)|(ICat A-Stem)|(ICat V-Stem)@End-Verbatim Either N-stem, A-stem or V-stem@Verbatim 	(ICat N-Interfix)|(ICat N-Suffix)^(Num Plur)@End-Verbatim Either N-Interfix or N-Suffix except N-Suffix with the feature for plural. The"not"-operator refers only to the feature (set) specified immediatly before it. @Verbatim 	(ICat Adj-Suffix)^(Gender Fem)^(Number Plur)@End-Verbatim All Adj-suffixes that are neither feminine nor plural. The "not" operators arecoordinated, not embedded. Therefore, the example does not only excludeadj-suffixes that are feminine AND plural, but also adj-suffixes that are feminine OR  plural. @Section{'Value' Spelling Rules}@Index{value spelling rules}@Label{ "value-rule" }A normal @Link{ "spelling rule" | "spelling-rule" } produces one output for eachinput string, i.e. the input string is replaced by an output string according to the@Link{ "string replacement" | "string-replacement" } formulated in the spellingrule. A 'value' spelling rule is a spelling rule with two outputs: 1) the modified stringand 2) the unmodified input string. @SubSection{ISRules As 'Value' Rules}When the 'value' rule is an @Link{ "ISRule" | "ISRule" }, the subsequent ISRules areapplied on both outputs, on the modified string and on the unmodified string. Inthis manner, it is possible to generate two @Link{ "surface strings" |"surface-string" } out of one @Link{ "lexical string" | "lexical-string" }. This can be useful for the specification of wordforms or even whole inflectionalparadigms with two correct surface variants. E.g. the English noun "inflection"and "inflexion", the Dutch verb "controleren" and "kontroleren", etc.@SubSection{WFSRules As  'Value' Rules}When the the 'value' rule is a @Link{ "WFSRule" | "WFSRule" }, it produces twooutput strings, too. Unlike  'value' ISRules, 'value' WFSRules serve"only" for the formulation of an option between the  modified and theunmodified string. Not both the strings are passed on, but only the one that is manuallychosen: with @Link{ "hard coded entries" | "hard-coded-entry" } when the lexicalstring in the @Link{ "entry specification" | "entry-specification" } of the WFRuleis specified; with @Link{ "lexicographer entries" | "lexicographer-entry" }, whenthe target is generated. 'Value' WFSRules are useful for the specification of wordformation processes,with which a certain morphographic phenomenon occurs with some entries anddoes not occur with others, and where this alternative is not formallypredictable. E.g. certain German wordformation suffixes provoke somestems to be umlauted, meanwhile other stems remain unaltered. Which stemsare umlauted and which are not, is not unambiguously predictable:@Verbatim 		Arzt	Ärzt-in			Zar	Zar-in	Hund	Hünd-in			Kunde	Kund-in@End-Verbatim By the formulation of a 'value' rule, both processes, with and without umlaut,can be specified in one WFRule.  @SubSection{Specification of a 'Value' Rule}A normal spelling rule is made a 'value' spelling rule by simply adding a whitespace and the keyword "value" at the right end of the @Link{ "spelling rule body" |"spelling-rule-syntax" }. E.g.:@Verbatim 	"inflection/inflexion" (ICat N-Stem) value@End-VerbatimThe input string is "inflection", the output strings are "inflexion" and theunmodified string "inflection". @Verbatim 	"C(.*)/k\1" (ICat V-Stem) value	"C(.*)/c\1" (ICat V-Stem)@End-Verbatim The input is, e.g. the dutch noun stem "Copie", the output of the first spellingrule is "kopie" and "Copie". The second spelling Rule replaces "Copie" by "copie".Consequently, the lexical string "Copie" has the two surface variants "copie" and"kopie". @Chapter{Surface Character Set}@Index{surface character set}@Label{ "surface-character-set" }The surface character set window lists all characters that are used for therepresentation of @Link{ "surface strings" | "surface-string" }.

The complete feature set of an WFFormative is the sum of allWFCat features encountered on the way down from the root node to the leave node, plusthe WFCat features specified directly with the formative. @Section{Some Constraints On The Tree Organization}General: @Item On each node level, the local feature sets qualifying wordformationunits or leave nodes must be distinct, i.e. the sets must be pairwise non-identicaland no set may be a subset of another set.@End-Item@ItemA combined feature set of a wordformation unit or a leave node may not haveredundant features, i.e. each feature on the path from the root to a node mustbe unique.@End-ItemWFRule features:@ItemEach complete WFRule name must be distinct, i.e. complete WFRule names mustbe pairwise non-identical and no complete WFRule name may be a subset ofanother complete WFRule name. @End-Item@ItemA complete WFRule name may not contain redundant features, i.e. each feature on thepath from the root to the leave node must be unique. @End-Item WFFormative features:@ItemOn each node level (this includes the WFCat features specified directly with theformatives), the feature sets qualifying formatives must be distinct,which means that the sets must be pairwise non-identical and no set maybe a subset of another set. @End-Item@ItemCombined qualifying feature sets of formatives (this includes the WFCat featuresspecified directly with the formatives) may not contain redundant featuresi.e. each WFCat feature on the path from the root to a node must be unique.@End-Item@ItemNone of the combined qualifiying feature sets of formatives (this includesthe WFCat features specified directly with the formatives) may be a subset of anyother.@End-Item @Chapter{Wordformation Unit}@Index{wordformation unit}@Label{ "wordformation-unit" }A wordformation unit is a construct that groups a set of @Link{ "WFRules" |"WFRUle" } and @Link{ "WFFormatives" | "WFFormative" } into an entity. Themajor charactersitic of a wordformation unit is that the WFRules specifiedwithin it operate exclusively over the WFFormatives specified within it.The specification of wordformation units allows you to factor yourspecification into entities within which you can work 'locally'.Furthermore, they faciliate the @Link{ "compilation" | "compilation" } inlarger databases: When you choose the 'Run Compiler' command in theEdit menu, only the wordformation units that have been modified since thelast compilation are recompiled.  The beginning of a wordformation unit is marked by a @Link{ "RWFRulefeature" | "RWFRule-feature" } or an @Link{ "IWFRule feature" |"IWFRule-feature" }, where the first marks a RWFRule unit and the second anIWFRule unit. All WFRules and WFFormatives specified at the beginning leveland the underlying levels of the subtree belong to the same inflectionunit. First, the @Link{ "WFRules" | "WFRule" } are specified, followed, optionally, by the @Link{ "WFFormatives" | "WFFormative" }. @Example{Wordformation Units: German Verb-To-Adjective Derivation}@Verbatim 	(WFCat V_To_Adj)		(WFCat Suffixing)			(RWFRule No_Umlaut)			(RWFRule Umlaut)			(WFCat Suffix)				(WFCat Without_Umlaut)				(WFCat With_Umlaut)		(WFCat Conversion)			(RWFRule Present_Participle)			(RWFRule Past_Participle)@End-Verbatim @End-ExampleThe example shows a possible (incomplete) subtree for Germanverb-to-adjective derivation with @Itema RWRule unit for suffixing, initiated by the (RWFRule No_Umlaut) @End-Item@Itema RWFRule unit for conversion, initiatet by the (RWFRule Present_Participle)@End-Item
